Welcome to myTerminal v.1.0.0
Im glad you found your way here. 
Im here to guide you and help you make some sense out of it.
Well.. actually there's only one more command.

rps - Play 'rock paper scissors' with a COMPUTER. Sounds fun?
No? Well.. I tried. It's pretty simple you'll only use one of three options
rock, paper, scissors. You know how it works, good luck!

Whenever you get lost remember about the /help command
