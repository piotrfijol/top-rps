# [TOP] Rock Paper Scissors  
  
## Description 

The main goal of [this assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) is to create a simple 'rock, paper, scissors' game using console api to show messages to the user. However in this project i'll go beyond the given task and will include DOM manipulations (which happen to be a part of [another assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors). I did it a bit differently because I finished that exact assignment 'the right way' about two years ago. Since learning is all about fun I decided to make it very special.
  
## Summary

- Rock paper scissors game for 1 player
